# OShop

This project has been created using Angular and is held on Firebase (visit https://oshop-janow.firebaseapp.com/ in order to see it in action).

It contains several different issues, eg. admin-products template has been created using Angular List Component, whereas the rest of the application is build by Bootstrap 4. At this point, I am mostly focused on creating my own database and back-end in order to be independend of Firebase, thus this is not going to be changed/modified. 

If you have any questions, please contact me via email (nwkjan@gmail.com).
Feel free to comment it.

And...
many thanks to Mosh Hamedani, without whom the application would not be created.
